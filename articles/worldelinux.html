    <p>Hello! This is my first article. It is NOT the same as the blog - the blog is solely for updates on me/software/other stuff; articles are for
reviews/tutorials/other stuff.</p>

<p>It took me about two hours to find this answer. And it took me about five minutes to USE this answer. So thank me later. :P</p>

<p>Let’s get right into it.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If you’ve already been following a guide using JACK or something, <strong>stop</strong>. I never got it to work (the output from the Easykey was running on a different program
than the speakers so I couldn’t connect them) and it bogs down my PC - I don’t know about yours.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Plug your musical keyboard into the computer</strong> (normal keyboard helps too). I <em>strongly</em> suggest using USB, there are adapters online if you have MIDI. However,
if you can’t for some reason (it doesn’t work; you don’t have an adapter and can’t buy one; <del>you don’t have USB</del> If you aren’t living under a rock, you have USB)
then plug it into your MIDI port. Just realize, there may be a small loss of quality due to this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Install a synthesizer.</strong> I use Yoshimi, it’s preinstalled on Elive Linux. On debian which is what this guide is for - simply run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo apt install yoshimi</code>; it
should work. You could also use another synthesizer if you prefer; I simply know and love Yoshimi.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Open the synth.</strong> It needs to be running to be recognized by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aconnect</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Install <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aconnectgui</code>.</strong> On Debian run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo apt install aconnectgui</code>. This will pull in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aconnect</code> too if you prefer the command line but I’m not helping
with that.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Launch aconnectgui.</strong> You can run it from a terminal. I know it looks old but it’s the way I did it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Connect the input/output/whateverput.</strong> You need to click the cable icon at the top. Then, drag the &gt; protruding from “WORLDE easy key MIDI ONE” or something
similar, to the &lt; protruding from the input of your synthesizer. In my case, there’s an input under the category “yoshimi”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Play away!</strong> You will need to change the synth settings - in Yoshimi it defaults to a boring sound.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’m pretty sure notation software can be passed MIDI data in this way, but I will need to check. I’ll update the article with information. :D</p>
  </li>

<p>I really like this keyboard. Would be nice if it has speakers or at least a headphone jack. Works fine with Yoshimi. NOTE: I did not pay for this; I picked it up from a friend, so it may not be as good if you pay $90 for it.</p>
