    <p>Happy Remembrance Day! I’m keeping all the veterans in my head - and you should too.</p>

<p>Remembrance Day is all about remembering these veterans. You shouldnt treat it as any other day because that’s disrespectful to the veterans.</p>

<p>All in all, as yet another Remembrance Day passes, think of all they did for you. I am seriously astounded that they only get one day.</p>
